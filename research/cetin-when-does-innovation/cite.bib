 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel measure based on patents to identify firms that have a better pipeline for innovations and have a better potential to innovate successfully. Specifically, using advanced machine learning techniques, we compare the textual similarity and distinctiveness of the topical content of each pair of patent claim sections in a firm's innovation pipeline. We first present evidence that firms with a more distinct set of claims have better innovation and operational performance in the future. Second, we show that our measure is a significant predictor of future stock returns up to three year period. Finally, we compare risk-based and underreaction-based explanations for return predictability and find overwhelming support for the risk-based explanation.},
