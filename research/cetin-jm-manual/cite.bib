 abstract = {In this paper, I reflect on my journey through the 2022-2023 Academic Accounting Rookie Job Market, an experience shaped by both traditional challenges and the evolving landscape of post-COVID academia. Predominantly focusing on the schools that are active in the US market, I also navigated interactions with European institutions. This journey culminated in my appointment at the London School of Economics, a position that fills me with deep honor. I owe immense gratitude to my mentors who illuminated my path, and I aspire to give back by sharing the valuable advice and firsthand experiences I gathered. While this paper seeks to assist future job market candidates by shedding light on the intricacies of job applications, interviews, flyouts, offers, and the emotional roller coaster of the hiring process, it remains a reflection of my personal experiences. Consequently, readers are advised to engage with its content judiciously.},
