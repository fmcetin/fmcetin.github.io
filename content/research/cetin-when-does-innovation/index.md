abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel measure based on patents to identify firms
  that have a better pipeline for innovations and have a better potential to innovate
  successfully. Specifically, using advanced machine learning techniques, we compare
  the textual similarity and distinctiveness of the topical content of each pair of
  patent claim sections in a firm's innovation pipeline. We first present evidence
  that firms with a more distinct set of claims have better innovation and operational
  performance in the future. Second, we show that our measure is a significant predictor
  of future stock returns up to three year period. Finally, we compare risk-based
  and underreaction-based explanations for return predictability and find overwhelming
  support for the risk-based explanation.
