abstract: This study investigates the impact of the recent revenue recognition rule
  change, Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 606, on drug development firms' investments
  in R&D alliances and innovation outcomes. ASC 606 allows managers to change revenue
  recognition timing and increases disclosure requirements. I first document that
  drug development firms dependent on R&D alliance revenues accelerate revenue recognition
  and concurrently disclose more about the recognition process following ASC 606 adoption.
  Consistent with the net result being a decrease in information asymmetry between
  managers and investors, these firms access more capital and increase investments
  in R&D. Importantly, they form more R&D alliances consistent with the information
  asymmetry between peer firms also decreasing upon adopting ASC 606. In particular,
  firms that primarily provide technology in return for payments before ASC 606 become
  more likely to pay and acquire technology after ASC 606. Thus, the structure of
  alliances within the industry significantly changes. Finally, I show that affected
  drug development firms exhibit higher innovation, proxied for by the number of drug
  candidates, number of patents, patent values, and citations. These findings suggest
  a specific and concrete mechanism of the real effects of a specific financial reporting
  standard on R&D alliances and innovation outcomes.
