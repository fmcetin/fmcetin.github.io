abstract: Highly efficient cell-free enzymatic systems are typically difficult to
  achieve in traditional immobilized enzyme systems because of the lack of optimal
  spatial control of enzyme localization, substrate and product diffusion, and enzyme
  and coenzyme accessibility. Here, we report a strategy for expanding the pore apertures
  (from 3.3 to 6.7~nm) of a series of Zr-based metallic-organic frameworks (MOFs)
  (termed NU-100x, x~= 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) with interconnected hierarchical pores by maintaining
  precise control of torsional angles associated with the linkers. As a proof of concept,
  we use the expanded NU-100x MOF structures to encapsulate lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH) and demonstrate the use of the captured protein in a cell-free biosynthetic
  catalytic system. Remarkably, LDH immobilized in the large pores of the MOF is accessible
  to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzymes (NAD and NADH), allowing for in situ
  coenzyme regeneration leading to higher activity than that of the free enzyme.
