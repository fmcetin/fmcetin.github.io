abstract: Designing new materials for the effective detoxification of chemical warfare
  agents (CWAs) is of current interest given the recent use of CWAs. Although halogenated
  boron-dipyrromethene derivatives (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene or
  BDP or BODIPY) at the 2 and 6 positions have been extensively explored as efficient
  photosensitizers for generating singlet oxygen (1O2) in homogeneous media, their
  utilization in the design of porous organic polymers (POPs) has remained elusive
  due to the difficulty of controlling polymerization processes through cross-coupling
  synthesis pathways. Our approach to overcome these difficulties and prepare halogenated
  BODIPY-based porous organic polymers (X-BDP-POP where X = Br or I) represents an
  attractive alternative through post-synthesis modification (PSM) of the parent hydrogenated
  polymer. Upon synthesis of both the parent polymer, H-BDP-POP, and its post-synthetically
  modified derivatives, Br-BDP-POP and I-BDP-POP, the BET surface areas of all POPs
  have been measured and found to be 640, 430, and 400 m2$·$g– 1, respectively. In
  addition, the insertion of heavy halogen atoms at the 2 and 6 positions of the BODIPY
  unit leads to the quenching of fluorescence (both polymer and solution-phase monomer
  forms) and the enhancement of phosphorescence (particularly for the iodo versions
  of the polymers and monomers), as a result of efficient intersystem crossing. The
  heterogeneous photocatalytic activities of both the parent POP and its derivatives
  for the detoxification of the sulfur mustard simulant, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide
  (CEES), have been examined; the results show a significant enhancement in the generation
  of singlet oxygen (1O2). Both the bromination and iodination of H-BDP-POP served
  to shorten by 5-fold of the time needed for the selective and catalytic photo-oxidation
  of CEES to 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO).
