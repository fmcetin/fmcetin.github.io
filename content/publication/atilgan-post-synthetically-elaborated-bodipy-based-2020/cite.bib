 abstract = {Designing new materials for the effective detoxification of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) is of current interest given the recent use of CWAs. Although halogenated boron-dipyrromethene derivatives (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene or BDP or BODIPY) at the 2 and 6 positions have been extensively explored as efficient photosensitizers for generating singlet oxygen (1O2) in homogeneous media, their utilization in the design of porous organic polymers (POPs) has remained elusive due to the difficulty of controlling polymerization processes through cross-coupling synthesis pathways. Our approach to overcome these difficulties and prepare halogenated BODIPY-based porous organic polymers (X-BDP-POP where X = Br or I) represents an attractive alternative through post-synthesis modification (PSM) of the parent hydrogenated polymer. Upon synthesis of both the parent polymer, H-BDP-POP, and its post-synthetically modified derivatives, Br-BDP-POP and I-BDP-POP, the BET surface areas of all POPs have been measured and found to be 640, 430, and 400 m2$·$g– 1, respectively. In addition, the insertion of heavy halogen atoms at the 2 and 6 positions of the BODIPY unit leads to the quenching of fluorescence (both polymer and solution-phase monomer forms) and the enhancement of phosphorescence (particularly for the iodo versions of the polymers and monomers), as a result of efficient intersystem crossing. The heterogeneous photocatalytic activities of both the parent POP and its derivatives for the detoxification of the sulfur mustard simulant, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), have been examined; the results show a significant enhancement in the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2). Both the bromination and iodination of H-BDP-POP served to shorten by 5-fold of the time needed for the selective and catalytic photo-oxidation of CEES to 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO).},
