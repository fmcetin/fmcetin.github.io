ASC 606 allows managers to change revenue recognition timing and increases disclosure requirements. I first document that drug development firms dependent on R\u0026D alliance revenues accelerate revenue recognition and concurrently disclose more about the recognition process following ASC 606 adoption. Consistent with the net result being a decrease in information asymmetry between managers and investors, these firms access more capital and increase investments in R\u0026D. Importantly, they form more R\u0026D alliances consistent with the information asymmetry between peer firms also decreasing upon adopting ASC 606. In particular, firms that primarily provide technology in return for payments before ASC 606 become more likely to pay and acquire technology after ASC 606. Thus, the structure of alliances within the industry significantly changes. Finally, I show that affected drug development firms exhibit higher innovation, proxied for by the number of drug candidates, number of patents, patent values, and citations. These findings suggest a specific and concrete mechanism of the real effects of a specific financial reporting standard on R\u0026D alliances and innovation outcomes.","tags":[],"title":"The Real Effects of Accounting on Innovation: Evidence from ASC 606","type":"research"},{"authors":["Furkan Mustafa Cetin","Ferhat Akbas","Egemen Genc"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668560259,"objectID":"b559d508e6aad0b72fa6bf4f4b6d5769","permalink":"https://fmcetin.github.io/research/cetin-when-does-innovation/","publishdate":"2022-11-16T00:57:39.455748Z","relpermalink":"/research/cetin-when-does-innovation/","section":"research","summary":"In this paper, we propose a novel measure based on patents to identify firms that have a better pipeline for innovations and have a better potential to innovate successfully.

We first present evidence that firms with a more distinct set of claims have better innovation and operational performance in the future.

Although halogenated boron-dipyrromethene derivatives (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene or BDP or BODIPY) at the 2 and 6 positions have been extensively explored as efficient photosensitizers for generating singlet oxygen (1O2) in homogeneous media, their utilization in the design of porous organic polymers (POPs) has remained elusive due to the difficulty of controlling polymerization processes through cross-coupling synthesis pathways. Our approach to overcome these difficulties and prepare halogenated BODIPY-based porous organic polymers (X-BDP-POP where X = Br or I) represents an attractive alternative through post-synthesis modification (PSM) of the parent hydrogenated polymer. Upon synthesis of both the parent polymer, H-BDP-POP, and its post-synthetically modified derivatives, Br-BDP-POP and I-BDP-POP, the BET surface areas of all POPs have been measured and found to be 640, 430, and 400 m2$¬∑$g‚Äì 1, respectively. In addition, the insertion of heavy halogen atoms at the 2 and 6 positions of the BODIPY unit leads to the quenching of fluorescence (both polymer and solution-phase monomer forms) and the enhancement of phosphorescence (particularly for the iodo versions of the polymers and monomers), as a result of efficient intersystem crossing. The heterogeneous photocatalytic activities of both the parent POP and its derivatives for the detoxification of the sulfur mustard simulant, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), have been examined; the results show a significant enhancement in the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2). Both the bromination and iodination of H-BDP-POP served to shorten by 5-fold of the time needed for the selective and catalytic photo-oxidation of CEES to 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO).","tags":[],"title":"Post-Synthetically Elaborated BODIPY-Based Porous Organic Polymers (POPs) for the Photochemical Detoxification of a Sulfur Mustard Simulant","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

As a proof of concept, we use the expanded NU-100x MOF structures to encapsulate lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and demonstrate the use of the captured protein in a cell-free biosynthetic catalytic system.
